# Zaac Learning Management System

## Overview
The Zaac learning management system is a virtual tutorial video management system designed to prevent unauthorized access to lesson videos by students who have unsubscribed or are attempting to share passwords. The system consists of an admin panel and a mobile application for students. The admin panel allows administrators to manage classes, subjects, students, assignments, and more. Information added through the admin panel is synchronized with students' Zaac mobile application upon registration. The student application restricts students from taking screenshots, recording video sessions, or downloading videos. Additionally, each student can only access the application on one device, preventing unauthorized sharing of accounts. Special features are available in the admin panel to reset a student's device in case of loss.
